# 🚀 Simple Blockchain Project

A Python-based blockchain simulator demonstrating **core blockchain principles**, enhanced with **Proof-of-Work mining**, a **Flask-powered REST API**, and automated **unit testing**.  

This project is designed as an **educational tool** to showcase how blocks, hashes, and validation create a secure, immutable ledger.

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Simple-Blockchain-Project.git
cd Simple-Blockchain-Project
````

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Run the Blockchain Server

```bash
python src/simple_blockchain.py
```

By default, the server runs at:
👉 `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### REST API Endpoints

* **Mine a new block**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"data":"My first transaction"}'
  ```

  ✅ Response includes the new block details.

* **Fetch the entire blockchain**

  ```bash
  curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/chain
  ```

  ✅ Returns all blocks, chain length, and validity.

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

To ensure integrity:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

* Tests blockchain validity.
* Ensures tampering is detected.

---

## ✅ Features

* 📦 **Block creation & chaining** with metadata (index, timestamp, data, previous hash).
* 🔒 **SHA-256 hashing** for immutability.
* ⛏️ **Proof-of-Work mining** (adjustable difficulty).
* 🌐 **Flask REST API** for interacting with blockchain.
* 🧪 **Unit tests** for reliability.
* 🐳 **Dockerized deployment** for portability.

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

* 🤝 Peer-to-peer networking (multiple nodes maintaining the chain).
* 🗳️ Consensus algorithms (Proof-of-Stake, Delegated PoS, etc.).
* 💼 Wallet & transaction system with public/private keys.
* 📊 Web dashboard for visualizing the blockchain.
* 🔗 Smart contract demo for advanced use cases.

## 📸 Example Output

When mining blocks:

```
Mining block 1...
Block mined: 000af91e92f57...
Mining block 2...
Block mined: 000bd12a4f8d...
```

Blockchain validation:

```
Blockchain valid? True
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment (Optional)

Build and run in a container:

```bash
docker build -t blockchain .
docker run -p 5000:5000 blockchain
```
